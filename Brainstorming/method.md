### Trusting intentions
* **Willingness to depend**
  * I would feel comfortable to purchase from the site
  * I would secure following the tips given from the website

## Method 1
### Description
* Only one website is used.
* Split the participants into two groups:
  * Group A: Will only see the website with a **light theme**.
  * Group B: Will only see the website with a **dark theme**
  * Group A and B will then answer the same form about their trust towards the site.
  * Ask about their experiences with dark mode on other applications.
* We are then comparing the result between the forms to make a conclusion about the themes effect on trust.

### Flaws
* Because we are only using one website, it may happened that the design used on the website may work better with a dark or light theme. We there for can not make the conclusion that a dark or light theme is better for all website designs.
  * A solution would be to use multiple websites with different design. However, it may be hard to choose "different designs" and keep track of every positive element that can effect the users trust.

* Because the website are not compared directly to each other, the way participants think of the question as well as the participants value different element on the page differently, e.g. the product description or the product image, may vary. It is therefore hard to analyse the themes effect on the trust as their are many other factors effecting trust.
  * To minimize the error, question can be added to the form asking the participates what elements in the website that they value.

## Method 2
### Description
* Only one website is used.
* The participants compare the website with different themes directly to each other.
  * We tell the participant that one of the themes . We assume that chosen website feels most normal to them, indicating that the participant have a higher institution-based trust towards the chosen website.
  * Ask the participants what theme gives the most professional look. The chosen website is indicating that the participants have a higher trusting belief that the chosen website is competent in what they do.
  * Ask the participant to explain why they choose the chosen theme in the two questions.
* Ask about their experiences with dark mode on other applications.

### Flaws
* Because we are only using one website, it may happened that the design used on the website may work better with a dark or light theme.
* It is not a normal situation to compare a dark and light theme directly to each other?
* The data only includes institution-based trust for situational normality  and trusting belief for competence.
